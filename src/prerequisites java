Java documentation that can be used:
    1. Java Crypto Documentation: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html
    2. Java Crypto Name Standards (mandatory): https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/StandardNames.html
    3. Bouncy Castle Documentation: https://www.bouncycastle.org/specifications.html

The second documentation is essential, due to having to memorize algorithms instead.
